# Cloudinary Image Deletion Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of automatic Cloudinary image deletion when properties are updated or deleted. This ensures that unused images are cleaned up from Cloudinary storage, preventing storage bloat and reducing costs.

## Implementation Details

### Updated Routes

#### PUT /api/properties/[id] - Property Update

- **Image Deletion Logic**: When updating a property, the system now compares the existing images with the new images
- **Removed Images**: Images that exist in the old property but not in the new property are automatically deleted from Cloudinary
- **Error Handling**: If image deletion fails, the property update continues (non-blocking)
- **Logging**: Successful deletions are logged for monitoring

#### DELETE /api/properties/[id] - Property Deletion

- **Complete Cleanup**: When deleting a property, all associated images are deleted from Cloudinary first
- **Database Cleanup**: Only after successful image deletion, the property is removed from the database
- **Error Handling**: If image deletion fails, the property deletion still proceeds (non-blocking)
- **Logging**: Successful deletions are logged for monitoring

### Key Functions Used

1. **`extractPublicId(url)`**: Extracts Cloudinary public ID from image URLs
2. **`deleteMultipleImages(publicIds)`**: Deletes multiple images from Cloudinary
3. **`deleteImage(publicId)`**: Deletes a single image from Cloudinary

### Code Flow

#### Property Update Flow:

1. Get existing property from database
2. Parse new property data (form-data or JSON)
3. Upload new images to Cloudinary
4. Compare existing images with new images
5. Delete removed images from Cloudinary
6. Update property in database
7. Return success response

#### Property Deletion Flow:

1. Get property from database
2. Extract all image URLs
3. Extract public IDs from URLs
4. Delete all images from Cloudinary
5. Delete property from database
6. Return success response

### Error Handling

- **Non-blocking**: Image deletion failures don't prevent property operations
- **Logging**: All errors are logged to console for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even if Cloudinary is unavailable

### Benefits

1. **Storage Management**: Prevents unused images from accumulating in Cloudinary
2. **Cost Reduction**: Reduces Cloudinary storage costs
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensures database and Cloudinary stay in sync
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual intervention required

### Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

- Property updates with image changes
- Property deletions with multiple images
- Error scenarios (invalid URLs, network issues)
- Both form-data and JSON request formats

### Monitoring

- Check console logs for deletion success/failure messages
- Monitor Cloudinary dashboard for storage usage
- Use Cloudinary API to verify image deletion

## Usage Examples

### Updating a Property with Image Changes

```javascript
// Frontend sends updated property data
const response = await fetch(`/api/properties/${propertyId}`, {
  method: "PUT",
  body: formData, // Contains new images and property data
});

// Backend automatically:
// 1. Uploads new images
// 2. Deletes removed images from Cloudinary
// 3. Updates property in database
```

### Deleting a Property

```javascript
// Frontend sends delete request
const response = await fetch(`/api/properties/${propertyId}`, {
  method: "DELETE",
});

// Backend automatically:
// 1. Deletes all images from Cloudinary
// 2. Deletes property from database
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The implementation uses existing Cloudinary configuration from environment variables:

- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Implement bulk image deletion for multiple properties
2. **Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanism for failed deletions
3. **Metrics**: Add metrics collection for deletion success rates
4. **Admin Interface**: Add admin controls for manual image cleanup
