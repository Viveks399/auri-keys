## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Watch the Console

Press `Ctrl + Alt + C` (Windows) or `Cmd + Alt + C` (Mac) to open Postman console and see detailed logs.

### 2. Check Environment Variables

Click the collection → Variables tab to see all saved values in real-time.

### 3. Use Test Images First

The collection includes 1x1 pixel test images. Test with these first, then replace with real images.

### 4. Save Custom Requests

Duplicate any request and modify it for your specific needs.

### 5. Run Collection

Use Collection Runner to run entire workflows automatically.

## 🔧 Customization

### Replace Test Images

The default requests use tiny test images. To use real images:

1. Convert your image to base64
   - Online: https://www.base64-image.de/
   - Node.js: `fs.readFileSync(path).toString('base64')`
2. Replace the base64 string in request body
3. Keep the `data:image/jpeg;base64,` prefix
