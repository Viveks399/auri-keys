## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Upload a Single Image

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload/images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,YOUR_BASE64_STRING",
    "folder": "properties"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../image.jpg",
    "publicId": "properties/abc123"
  },
  "message": "Image uploaded successfully"
}
```

### 2. Upload Multiple Images

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload/images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "images": ["base64_1", "base64_2", "base64_3"],
    "folder": "properties"
  }'
```

### 3. Delete an Image

  }'
```

## 💡 Integration Example

### Creating a Property with Images

```javascript
// Step 1: Upload images first
const imageUrls = [];
for (const file of selectedFiles) {
  const base64 = await fileToBase64(file);

  const uploadRes = await fetch("/api/upload/images", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ image: base64, folder: "properties" }),
  });

  const uploadData = await uploadRes.json();
  imageUrls.push(uploadData.data.url);
}

// Step 2: Create property with image URLs
const propertyRes = await fetch("/api/properties", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: "Luxury Villa",
    price: 1500000,
    images: imageUrls, // Cloudinary URLs here!
    location: {
      /* ... */
    },
    features: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // ... other data
  }),
});
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add Cloudinary credentials to `.env.local`
- [ ] Restart dev server
- [ ] Get JWT token via `/api/auth/login`
- [ ] Test upload with single image
- [ ] Test upload with multiple images
- [ ] Verify images appear in Cloudinary dashboard
- [ ] Test image deletion
- [ ] Create property with uploaded image URLs

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing Cloudinary credentials"

→ Check `.env.local` has all 3 Cloudinary variables  
→ Restart dev server after adding

### "Failed to upload image"

→ Check base64 encoding is valid  
→ Verify file size is under 10MB  
→ Check Cloudinary account quota

### "Authentication required"

→ Include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header  
→ Get fresh token from `/api/auth/login`

### Images not in Cloudinary dashboard

→ Verify cloud name is correct  
→ Check API key and secret are valid  
→ Look for errors in Cloudinary logs
